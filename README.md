ORMBuild
========

Builds ORM directly from MySQL database definitions supports Node Sequelize and PHP Laravel Eloquent

I have always thought that your MySQl field names should be so obvious that you could programmatically create your ORM objects from them. 

I love the ORM style of Laravel Eloquent and Nodes Sequelize. 

This script will auto generate ORMS for those projects from any MySQL database you point it to.
The constraints on table definitions are much stricter for Sequelize so it will complain when those do not match.

Hopefully this will make it easier to use Node and Laravel together by sharing data between them using MySQL.

Or it could be a terrible idea. It's so hard to tell sometimes. 

I hope this saves you some time.

I will try and write the code such that you could create other ORM files with mere templates...
