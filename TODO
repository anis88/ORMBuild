Its all about template generation now. 

There are a couple of approaches.

It seems reasonable to assume that the right method is to:

1. Create a new ORM controller that handles the basic CRUD in a RESTful manner...
2. The next question is how to handle the complexity of the per-object layouts... if possible, you would want this to be very very DRY. Possible options include:

	* Generating a ton of smarty interfaces... and then making the controller smart enough to detect custom smarty controllers and use those instead of compiled views...
        * making the generated ORM files all inherit from a new "Base" model class that knows how to make an html form from itself...
        * making the ORM controller smart enough to know how to make a form from a controller


The second two sound more DRY and better use of abstractions.

The the question comes about whether to auto-generate controllers. 
If we do autogenerate controllers then we should put them in a orm subdirectory...

or we could do smart routing... if there -is- a controller for a specific object then we use that... 
otherwise we call the main ORM controller and just pass in the object type from the route...

Or we could just do dumb routing to the ORM controller... and create secondary, non ORM controllers for fancy dashboard links...

When you are not so exausted that you cannot see straight. Re-read this and then make a decision...
